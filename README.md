Potato Platform Engine
====================

Yo dawgs we needa work on this shit.

Shit that needs to be worked on homes:

(Kay to tackle this)
Camera system that:
- Camera views
- Follows an object with weight
- Has options to follow multiple objects with multiple weights for each object
- Follow speed
- Zooming
- Ability for camera effect scripts

LevelEditor that:
- Makes levels
- Edits Levels

Sound System/Scripts:
- Plays sounds (probably .wav files)
- Plays music (probably .mp3s?)
- Plays ambience
- Able to detect what sounds are playing/limitting sounds playing at a given time
- Perhaps create a queue of sounds to remember what sounds are currently playing

Special Lighting Engine:
- Able to manipuate lighting/color tones on sprites
- Creates spotlights or areas with unique ambient lighting different from overall level lighting
- Light/darkness areas (can set a level to be dark, and have a small light on player or something)
- can generate 2D shadows?
